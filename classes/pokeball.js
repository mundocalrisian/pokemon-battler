    // Additionally, the method can be invoked with no argument.
    // In this case the method should return the stored Pokemon. The throw method should console log something like ("GO pokemonX's name!!") in this scenario.
    // If the ball is empty then the user should be informed accordingly.


    // isEmpty

    // Should return a boolean representing whether or not a Pokemon is stored inside it.


    // contains

    // Should return the name of the Pokemon that is stored or
    // If the pokeball is empty is should return "empty ...".
